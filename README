Class Catcher

  This program logs into hokiespa with given credentials.  It then checks
a given list of classes to see if any are open.  If the class is open,
the user is notified so he or she can add/drop the class.  In the future,
we might make it possible to add/drop a class from the program itself.

Installation

  The script requires python 3.0.  It is possible it may work for previous
versions but is not guaranteed.  In order to compile the GUI, gtkmm-3.0-dev
and its dependencies are required.  You can obtain the source or binary
packages from http://www.gtkmm.org/en/download.html.  Then to install, all
you have to do is run the Makefile.
